# Getting started

Dubbo-Node is a library for serving Dubbo, gRPC, and gRPC-Web compatible HTTP APIs using Node.js. It brings the Dubbo Protocol to Node with full TypeScript compatibility and support for all four types of remote procedure calls: unary and the three variations of streaming.

This ten-minute walkthrough helps you create a small Dubbo service in Node.js. It demonstrates what you'll be writing by hand, what Connect generates for you, and how to call your new API.


# Prerequisites
We'll set up a project from scratch and then augment it to serve a new endpoint.

- You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed - we recommend the most recent long-term support version (LTS).
- We'll use the package manager `npm`, but we are also compatible with `yarn` and `pnpm`.
- We'll also use [cURL](https://curl.se/). It's available from Homebrew and most Linux package managers.


# Project setup

Let's initialize a project with TypeScript, and install some code generation tools:

```shell
mkdir dubbo-example
cd dubbo-example
npm init -y
npm install typescript tsx
npx tsc --init
npm install @bufbuild/buf @bufbuild/protoc-gen-es @bufbuild/protobuf @apachedubbo/protoc-gen-apache-dubbo-es @apachedubbo/dubbo
```

# Define a service
First, we need to add a Protobuf file that includes our service definition. For this tutorial, we are going to construct a unary endpoint for a service that is a stripped-down implementation of [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), the famous natural language processing program.

```shell
mkdir -p proto && touch proto/eliza.proto
```

Open up the above file and add the following service definition:

```
syntax = "proto3";

package connectrpc.eliza.v1;

message SayRequest {
  string sentence = 1;
}

message SayResponse {
  string sentence = 1;
}

service ElizaService {
  rpc Say(SayRequest) returns (SayResponse) {}
}
```


# Generate code

We're going to generate our code using [Buf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/buf), a modern replacement for Google's protobuf compiler. We installed Buf earlier, but we also need a configuration file to get going. (If you'd prefer, you can skip this section and use `protoc` instead â€” `protoc-gen-apache-dubbo-es` behaves like any other plugin.)

First, tell Buf how to generate code with a `buf.gen.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: v1
plugins:
  - plugin: es
    opt: target=ts
    out: gen
  - plugin: dubbo-es
    opt: target=ts
    out: gen
```

With this file in place, you can generate code from the schema in the `proto` directory:

```shell
npx buf generate proto
```

You should now see two generated TypeScript files:

```markdown{3-5}
â”œâ”€â”€ buf.gen.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ gen
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ eliza_dubbo.ts
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ eliza_pb.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ proto
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ eliza.proto
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Next, we are going to use these files to implement our service.


# Implement the service

We defined the `ElizaService` - now it's time to implement it, and register it with the `DubboRouter`. First, let's create a file where we can put the implementation:

Create a new file `dubbo.ts` with the following contents:

```tsx
import type { ConnectRouter } from "@apachedubbo/dubbo";
import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_dubbo";

export default (router: DubboRouter) =>
  // registers dubborpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService
  router.service(ElizaService, {
    // implements rpc Say
    async say(req) {
      return {
        sentence: `You said: ${req.sentence}`
      }
    },
  });
```

That's it! There are many other alternatives to implementing a service, and you have access to a context object for headers and trailers, but let's keep it simple for now.


# Start a server

Dubbo services can be plugged into vanilla Node.js servers, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), or [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/). We are going to use Fastify here. Let's install it, along with our plugin for Fastify:

```shell
npm install fastify @apachedubbo/dubbo-node @apachedubbo/dubbo-fastify
```

Create a new file `server.ts` with the following contents:

```tsx
import { fastify } from "fastify";
import { fastifyDubboPlugin } from "@apachedubbo/dubbo-fastify";
import routes from "./connect";

async function main() {
  const server = fastify();
  await server.register(fastifyDubboPlugin, {
    routes,
  });
  server.get("/", (_, reply) => {
    reply.type("text/plain");
    reply.send("Hello World!");
  });
  await server.listen({ host: "localhost", port: 8080 });
  console.log("server is listening at", server.addresses());
}
// You can remove the main() wrapper if you set type: module in your package.json,
// and update your tsconfig.json with target: es2017 and module: es2022.
void main();
```

Congratulations. Your endpoint is ready to go! You can start your server with:

```shell
npx tsx server.ts
```

# Make requests

The simplest way to consume your new API is an HTTP/1.1 POST with a JSON payload. If you have a recent version of cURL installed, it's a one-liner:

```shell
curl \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"sentence": "I feel happy."}' \
   http://localhost:8080/dubborpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Say
```

---

```markdown
Output
{"sentence":"You said: I feel happy."}
```

You can also make requests using a Dubbo client. Create a new file client.ts with the following contents:

```tsx
import { createPromiseClient } from "@apachedubbo/dubbo";
import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_dubbo";
import { createDubboTransport } from "@apachedubbo/dubbo-node";

const transport = createDubboTransport({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
  httpVersion: "1.1"
});

async function main() {
  const client = createPromiseClient(ElizaService, transport);
  const res = await client.say({ sentence: "I feel happy." });
  console.log(res);
}
void main();
```

With your server still running in a separate terminal window, you can now run your client:

```shell
npx tsx client.ts
```

```markdown
Output
SayResponse { sentence: 'You said: I feel happy.' }
```

Congratulations â€” you've built your first Connect service! ðŸŽ‰


# From the browser

You can run the same client from a web browser, just by swapping out the Transport:

```tsx
import { createPromiseClient } from "@apachedubbo/dubbo";
import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_dubbo";
import { createDubboTransport } from "@apachedubbo/dubbo-web";

const transport = createDubboTransport({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
  // Not needed. Web browsers use HTTP/2 automatically.
  // httpVersion: "1.1"
});

async function main() {
  const client = createPromiseClient(ElizaService, transport);
  const res = await client.say({ sentence: "I feel happy." });
  console.log(res);
}
void main();
```


# Use the gRPC protocol instead of the Dubbo protocol

On Node.js, we support three protocols:

* The gRPC protocol that is used throughout the gRPC ecosystem.
* The gRPC-Web protocol used by [grpc/grpc-web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web), allowing servers to interop with `grpc-web` frontends without the need for an intermediary proxy (such as Envoy).
* The new [Dubbo protocol](https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/reference/protocols/), a simple, HTTP-based protocol that works over HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. It takes the best portions of gRPC and gRPC-Web, including streaming, and packages them into a protocol that works equally well in browsers, monoliths, and microservices. The Connect protocol is what we think the gRPC protocol should be. By default, JSON- and binary-encoded Protobuf is supported.

So far, we have been using the `http://` scheme in our examples. We were not using TLS (Transport Layer Security). If you want to use gRPC and browser clients during local development, you need TLS.

Actually, that only takes a minute to set up! We will use `mkcert` to make a certificate. If you don't have it installed yet, please run the following commands:

```shell
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem"
```

If you don't use macOS or `brew`, see the [mkcert docs](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation) for instructions. You can copy the last line to your `~/.zprofile` or `~/.profile`, so that the environment variable for Node.js is set every time you open a terminal.

Let's update our `server.ts` to use this certificate:

```tsx{4,8-12,17}
import { fastify } from "fastify";
import { fastifyDubboPlugin } from "@apachedubbo/dubbo-fastify";
import routes from "./connect";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

async function main() {
  const server = fastify({
    http2: true,
    https: {
      key: readFileSync("localhost+2-key.pem", "utf8"),
      cert: readFileSync("localhost+2.pem", "utf8"),
    }
  });
  await server.register(fastifyDubboPlugin, {
    routes,
  });
  await server.listen({ host: "localhost", port: 8443 });
  console.log("server is listening at", server.addresses());
}
void main();
```

That's it! After you restarted the server, you can still open [https://localhost:8443/](https://localhost:8443/) in your browser, but along with gRPC-Web and Connect, any gRPC client can access it too. Here's an example using `buf curl`:

```shell
npx buf curl --protocol grpc --schema . -d '{"sentence": "I feel happy."}' \
   https://localhost:8443/dubborpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Say
```

In your `client.ts`, update the URL and use HTTP version `2` and you're set. It will pick up the locally-trusted certificate authority, just like your web browser and other apps.


# So what?

With just a few lines of hand-written code, you've built a real API server that supports both the gRPC and Dubbo protocols. Unlike a hand-written REST service, you didn't need to design a URL hierarchy, hand-write request and response objects, or parse typed values out of query parameters. More importantly, your users got an idiomatic, type-safe client without any extra work on your part.
