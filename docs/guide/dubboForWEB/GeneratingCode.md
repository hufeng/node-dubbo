# Generating code

We mentioned earlier that the ELIZA service defines a Protocol Buffer schema. So what *is* that schema? It is really just a simple file that describes the service, its methods, and their argument and return types:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

service ElizaService {
  rpc Say(SayRequest) returns (SayResponse) {}
}

message SayRequest {
  string sentence = 1;
}

message SayResponse {
  string sentence = 1;
}
```

You can see the full version including comments and some additional RPCs [on the Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/connectrpc/eliza/file/main:connectrpc/eliza/v1/eliza.proto) (BSR). The `rpc` keyword stands for Remote Procedure Call — a method you can invoke remotely. The schema is the contract between server and client, and it precisely defines how data is exchanged down to the very details of serialization.

The schema comes to life by generating code. For the server, an interface is generated, and the developer can focus on filling the methods with business logic. For the client, there really isn't anything to do — the developer can just call the client methods, rely on the generated types for compile-time type-safety and serialization, and focus on the application logic.

## Generated SDKs

In the tutorial, we have been using [generated SDKs](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/npm) with an `npm install` command. When the package was requested on the BSR NPM registry, it ran the schema through a code generator, and served the generated files as a package with all required dependencies.

If you want to use a Dubbo or gRPC service whose schema is published on the BSR, you can simply use `npm` to install the package, and hit the service with a Dubbo client.

See our [documentation on generated SDKs](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/overview) for details.

## Local generation

We're going to generate our code using [Buf](https://buf.build/product/cli/), a modern replacement for Google's protobuf compiler, and two compiler plugins:

- [@apachedubbo/protoc-gen-apache-dubbo-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apachedubbo/protoc-gen-apache-dubbo-es) — generates services from your Protocol Buffer schema
- [@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es) — generates base types, like request and response messages

The code we will generate has three runtime dependencies:

- [@apachedubbo/dubbo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apachedubbo/dubbo) — provides clients, interceptors, errors, and other primitives for Dubbo
- [@apachedubbo/dubbo-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apachedubbo/dubbo-web) — provides the Dubbo and gRPC-web protocols for web browsers
- [@bufbuild/protobuf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bufbuild/protobuf) — provides serialization and more for the base types

First, let's install `buf`, the plugins and runtime dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @bufbuild/buf @apachedubbo/protoc-gen-apache-dubbo-es @bufbuild/protoc-gen-es
$ npm install @apachedubbo/dubbo @apachedubbo/dubbo @bufbuild/protobuf
```

Next, tell Buf to use the two plugins with a new configuration file:

```yaml
# buf.gen.yaml defines a local generation template.
# For details, see https://buf.build/docs/configuration/v1/buf-gen-yaml
version: v1
plugins:
  # This will invoke protoc-gen-es and write output to src/gen
  - plugin: es
    out: src/gen
    opt:
      # Add more plugin options here
      - target=ts
  # This will invoke protoc-gen-apache-dubbo-es
  - plugin: apache-dubbo-es
    out: src/gen
    opt:
      # Add more plugin options here
      - target=ts
```

If desired, you can also skip local plugin installation and use [remote plugins](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/overview). 

Finally, tell Buf to generate code for the ELIZA schema:

```bash
$ npx buf generate buf.build/apache-dubbo/eliza
```

If you prefer, you can use `protoc` instead of Buf — the plugins behave like any other plugin.

### Output

Let's take a peek at what was generated. There are two new files:

- `src/gen/apache-dubbo/eliza/v1/eliza_dubbo.ts`
- `src/gen/apache-dubbo/eliza/v1/eliza_pb.ts`

The first file was generated by `protoc-gen-apache-dubbo-es` and contains the service:

```ts
import { SayRequest, SayResponse } from "./eliza_pb.js";
import { MethodKind } from "@bufbuild/protobuf";

export const ElizaService = {
  typeName: "buf.connect.demo.eliza.v1.ElizaService",
  methods: {
    say: {
      name: "Say",
      I: SayRequest,
      O: SayResponse,
      kind: MethodKind.Unary,
    },
  }
} as const;
```

The full file includes comments and additional RPCs, but the `const` above really is all Dubbo needs to provide clients.

The second file was generated by `protoc-gen-es`, and contains the request and response classes. You can see them being imported for the service definition. To learn more about `protoc-gen-es`, head over to the documentation for the [Protobuf-ES project](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/main/docs/generated_code.md).

If your bundler does not handle the `.js` extension in the import `from "./eliza_pb.js"` correctly, you can configure it following our examples, or you can add the plugin option `import_extension=none` to remove the extension.

You can find the documentation for all available [plugin options on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apachedubbo/protoc-gen-apache-dubbo-es#plugin-options) .

### Using the local files

To use the locally generated files in the tutorial, update the import path:

```diff
- import { ElizaService } from "gen/eliza_dubboweb";
+ import { ElizaService } from "gen/eliza_dubbo";
```
